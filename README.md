# Chuck's Profile


This **project** is one of my first attempts at creating a website for someone. I don't expect it to have much, if any, JS associated with it right now. This is subject to change down the road as I complete coursework that allows me to add some more advanced effects.  
 





## Structure


The site is going to be card based meaning there will be a few cards named

1. Profile/Name

1. Hobbies

1. About

1. Footer(basic)

Each card would link to another page within the site and it will hold all of that information. 



## Design


I'll be designing everything on the side and will eventually upload pictures of my desired template. This should make things easier to follow or least give you an idea of what I was going for.

The key is to make sure that the landing page is as clean as possible. Again, this is my first go so I will do my best with that.



## Opening Issues


It's okay to open issues for problems that you may see arise. Issues can be anything from but limited to:

1. HTML & CSS Formatting

1. Grammatical Errors

1. CSS Rule Condensing


## Tasks

I expect the tasks to be updated throughout the entirety of this project. So far, here is what I have:

- [x] Create HTML File

- [x] Link CSS to HTML file for design updates

- [x] Link File from VS Code to GitHub

- [x] Check Grammatical mistakes daily

- [x] Update ReadMe with status updates

- [ ] Reach out and receieve an adequate profile photo from Chuck.  

- [ ] Reach out to mentor's for recommendations on where to move forward
