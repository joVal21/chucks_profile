              <p>I've always been a dog lover. There is nothing I wouldn't do to keep my daushhound safe. Some people say that owning a puppy is a lot of hard work and I agree. It takes time to nurture and train your pet but the process is one of the most rewarding in existence. It's one thing to see your pet grow over time but to see them show more and more love is an absolute pleasure.
